<h5>Shikhar Agrawal, 20th October 2020</h5>
We have got to this problem from studying the various documentaries made on the near seashore salt pan field workers in the state of Tamil-Nadu and Gujarat. These fields due to being in proximity to the sea are highly marshy and in certain seasons extremely difficult to traverse through.

<h5>Utkarsh Thakre, 20th October 2020</h5>
A vast majority of near salt-pan field are concetrated in the coastline of states of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Gujarat. In/Near the Rann of Gujarat the salt pans can be situated much far away from sea inside the land to as far as 50 kilometers. While the almost all of the Salt-pan fields along the coastline of Maharashtra, malabar and coromandal are situated in the close viscinity of sea.

<h5>Shikhar Agarwal 20th October 2020</h5>
<p>A salt marsh, also known as a coastal salt marsh or a tidal marsh, is a coastal ecosystem found between land and open salt water that is regularly flooded by the tides. A salt marsh begins when mud and silt are deposited along a sheltered part of the coastline. This is because rates of deposition are greater than transportation due to the lack of energy in the waves. Often salt marsh is found on the inside of a coastal spit. The deposition builds up over time meaning that the mud breaks the surface to form mudflats. These salt marshes also protect shorelines from erosion by buffering wave action and trapping sediments. They reduce flooding by slowing and absorbing rainwater and protect water quality by filtering runoff, and by metabolizing excess nutrients.</p>

Ambubahi, Saltpan worker in Gujarat: &quot;The season starts at around this time only in october, it depends on the monsoon. Now we have started to migrate to there with all our family and livelihood. Though the region is still flooded and it is very difficult to go traverse through those regions. Often if possible in some places the tractors are used, which also get stuck in the marsh many times. We had used them for taking our things there, though not everyone has than option. It depends on the location or difficulty of marsh and wheather one can afford that.&quot;</p>

 <div id="Context" class="tabcontent">
     <h2> Context</h2>
<p>How do marshes affect their operation: A seasonal salt marsh located just 10Kms from Arabian sea.This area is under water during the monsoon months and salt farming starts early October, after the water starts  to recede. The Salt workers continue to live and work in this area for the next 7 months, making these salt pans their temporary home, living in make shift shacks, all around the pans. In shifting their housing to these salt pan areas, they have to bear a lot of pain and also time consuming in moving all their necessities to these areas while walking on these marshy lands. </p>

<h5>Utkarsh Thakre, 20th October 2020</h5>      
<p>Understanding the actual problem that is at the core of the unmet needs is very important in order to proceed in the further stages of design process.For the case of the salt pan workers living and working in the fields near the sea shore, though it was very evident that what was their unmet needs. But it was not very clear what exact kinds of issues and problems they were facing.<br>
<div style="text-align: center"><img alt="Comprehension-f8676087.png" src="assets/Comprehension-f8676087.png" width="300" height="300"></div><br>
Now as discussed in the previous stages, at times when monsoon starts to with draw they start to move to the salt pans from their native villages. Now they have to transfer their complete family including children and livelihood. This include the things of basic necessity, ration, house building material, burning woods etc.<br>
These constitute heavy weight. On other occasion they need to transport goods or heavy equipments through lands flooded by tidal waves.</p>
<h2 class="mume-header" id="detailed-study-on-soil-composition-of-the-marshes">Detailed study on soil composition of the Marshes</h2>
<h5>Utkarsh Thakre, 20th October 2020</h5>
<p>From our detailed study on these salt pan workers adnd the conditions associated with the marshes. We found out:</p>
<ul>
<li>In general these Marshes consist of following layers</li>
<div style="text-align: center"><img alt="Comprehension-2b292792.png" src="assets/Comprehension-2b292792.png" width="300" height="300"></div>
<li>The top layer of marshes are the one with most water content and act like a suction and pull any weight that is on the soil downwards.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="mume-header" id="difficulty-associated-with-walking">Difficulty associated with walking</h2>
<h5>Utkarsh Thakre, 20th October 2020</h5>
<ul>
<li>So when a saltpan worker tries to traverse through these marshes, he faces two major difficulty.</li>
<li>Firstly the legs get stuck in the top layer needs to pulled up everytime with lots of energy</li>
<li>Secondly the next leg needs to be moved forward against a dense soil resistance, which agains consumes a lots of energy</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Vehilces need traction to move forward but on such a muddy there is lots of skidding</li>
<li>The marshses are uneven there can be a very large invisible hole under the water where one on the wheel will get stuck badly.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>With no other choices left they to labour for hours for to use some make shift things like the above image shows.</li>
<li>They put the heavy object to trasport on a plank or a sheet of tin.</li>
<li>Ropes are tied and the things are pulled mannually by the saltpan workers</li>
<li>The working conditions are harsh and such a high energy intensive tasks leads to dehydration and high fatigue in the body</li>
<li>Sometimes just due to these problems they have to take a very long alternate routes to reach their destination.</li>
<li>Marshes can be very if help does not arrive in dire cases.</li>
