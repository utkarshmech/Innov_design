<p>We have got to this problem from studying the various documentaries made on the near seashore salt pan field workers in the state of Tamil-Nadu and Gujarat. These fields due to being in proximity to the sea are highly marshy and in certain seasons extremely difficult to traverse through.</p>

<div style="text-align: center"><img alt="home-44ca3c9c.png" src="assets/home-44ca3c9c.png" width="300" height="300"></div>

<p>A vast majority of near salt-pan field are concetrated in the coastline of states of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Gujarat. In/Near the Rann of Gujarat the salt pans can be situated much far away from sea inside the land to as far as 50 kilometers. While the almost all of the Salt-pan fields along the coastline of Maharashtra, malabar and coromandal are situated in the close viscinity of sea.</p>
<h2 class="mume-header" id="how-salt-marshes-are-formed">How Salt Marshes are formed:</h2>
        

<p>A salt marsh, also known as a coastal salt marsh or a tidal marsh, is a coastal ecosystem found between land and open salt water that is regularly flooded by the tides. A salt marsh begins when mud and silt are deposited along a sheltered part of the coastline. This is because rates of deposition are greater than transportation due to the lack of energy in the waves. Often salt marsh is found on the inside of a coastal spit. The deposition builds up over time meaning that the mud breaks the surface to form mudflats. These salt marshes also protect shorelines from erosion by buffering wave action and trapping sediments. They reduce flooding by slowing and absorbing rainwater and protect water quality by filtering runoff, and by metabolizing excess nutrients.</p>

<p>Ambubahi, Saltpan worker in Gujarat: &quot;The season starts at around this time only in october, it depends on the monsoon. Now we have started to migrate to there with all our family and livelihood. Though the region is still flooded and it is very difficult to go traverse through those regions. Often if possible in some places the tractors are used, which also get stuck in the marsh many times. We had used them for taking our things there, though not everyone has than option. It depends on the location or difficulty of marsh and wheather one can afford that.&quot;</p>

 <div id="Context" class="tabcontent">
     <h1> Context</h1>
<h2>Under standing the problem in user context</h2>
<p> Understanding the problem space in which a user functions is a very important aspect to innovate or design a product for a user. So for salt pan workers, they have to carry huge machines like pumps, tools for agriculture through the marshy lands in which their legs can get struck and also sometimes even the machine due to its weight gets buried under the soil. 
</p>
     <h2>How do marshes affect their operation:</h2>  
<div style="text-align: center"><img alt="home-44ca3c9c.png" src="assets/Context_tract.png" width="300" height ="300"></div>
<p>A seasonal salt marsh located just 10Kms from Arabian sea.This area is under water during the monsoon months and salt farming starts early October, after the water starts  to recede. The Salt workers continue to live and work in this area for the next 7 months, making these salt pans their temporary home, living in make shift shacks, all around the pans. In shifting their housing to these salt pan areas, they have to bear a lot of pain and also time consuming in moving all their necessities to these areas while walking on these marshy lands. </p>

<div style="text-align: center"><img alt="home-44ca3c9c.png" src="assets/home-44ca3c9c.png" width="300" height="250"></div>

<h3>The heavy rainfall in coastal Tamil nadu and Andhra increases the issues </h3>
<div style="text-align: center"><img alt="home-44ca3c9c.png" src="assets/Context_man.png" width="300" height="250"></div>
<p>The Agarias engaged in salt production, spent eight months of a year in remote locations devoid of any infrastructure for housing, health, education and drinking water, so for all these basic amenities they regularly travel to their native village through these marshy lands. While problems for Residents of near shore salt pan fields in Tamil Nadu and Andhra is way more serious. When these salt workers walk barefooted on these marshy lands, their feet get buried under the soil, where these small insects and microorganisms like bacteria and fungi can cause diseases which can be very dangerous.

<div id="Comprehension" class="tabcontent">
    <h1>Comprehension</h1>
    
<p>Understanding the actual problem that is at the core of the unmet needs is very important in order to proceed in the further stages of design process.For the case of the salt pan workers living and working in the fields near the sea shore, though it was very evident that what was their unmet needs. But it was not very clear what exact kinds of issues and problems they were facing.<br></p>
<div style="text-align: center"><img alt="Comprehension-f8676087.png" src="assets/Comprehension-f8676087.png" width="300" height="250"></div><br>
<p>Now as discussed in the previous stages, at times when monsoon starts to with draw they start to move to the salt pans from their native villages. Now they have to transfer their complete family including children and livelihood. This include the things of basic necessity, ration, house building material, burning woods etc.<br>
These constitute heavy weight. On other occasion they need to transport goods or heavy equipments through lands flooded by tidal waves.</p>
<h2 class="mume-header" id="detailed-study-on-soil-composition-of-the-marshes">Detailed study on soil composition of the Marshes</h2>

<p>From our detailed study on these salt pan workers adnd the conditions associated with the marshes. We found out:</p>
<div style="text-align: center"><img alt="Comprehension-2b292792.png" src="assets/Comprehension-2b292792.png" width="300" height="250"></div>
<ul>
<li>In general these Marshes consist of following layers</li>
<li>The top layer of marshes are the one with most water content and act like a suction and pull any weight that is on the soil downwards.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="mume-header" id="difficulty-associated-with-walking">Difficulty associated with walking</h2>

<ul>
<li>So when a saltpan worker tries to traverse through these marshes, he faces two major difficulty.</li>
<li>Firstly the legs get stuck in the top layer needs to pulled up everytime with lots of energy</li>
<li>Secondly the next leg needs to be moved forward against a dense soil resistance, which agains consumes a lots of energy</li>
</ul>

<li>Vehilces need traction to move forward but on such a muddy there is lots of skidding</li>
<li>The marshses are uneven there can be a very large invisible hole under the water where one on the wheel will get stuck badly.</li>

<li>With no other choices left they to labour for hours for to use some make shift things like the above image shows.</li>
<li>They put the heavy object to trasport on a plank or a sheet of tin.</li>
<li>Ropes are tied and the things are pulled mannually by the saltpan workers</li>
<li>The working conditions are harsh and such a high energy intensive tasks leads to dehydration and high fatigue in the body</li>
<li>Sometimes just due to these problems they have to take a very long alternate routes to reach their destination.</li>
<li>Marshes can be very if help does not arrive in dire cases.</li>

<div id="Checks" class="tabcontent">
      <h2>Checks</h2>
This is the most valuable stage in design innovation. It gives a clear direction to the design innovation, without losing focus on the target user needs.<br>
After discussing and researching about all the possible details and information related to the problems these poor people face in salt marshers. We needed to make something for them, that will help them ease their troubles. We decided to make target each small problem that we learnt from our detail comprehension and include it in our checklist as an feature that our product will try to accomodate. Each of these feature will mitigate the troubles caused by the individual or a multiple of small problems. <br>
  Here our target users are the salt pan workers and the following are the checks needed to be taken into account :

<h3> Require less effort and have low weight as compared to jugaad they currently use : </h3> <p>There are heavy loads (for ex: generator) that are to be carried using this tool. The weight of the tool itself should not be very high otherwise it will increase the overall load and make load carrying harder. The tool is to be designed in order to reduce the efforts they currently put in to carry load
</p>
<h3> Must be affordable : </h3> <p>The workers do not have high income and hence the tool needs to be affordable and easily available</p>
<h3> Made of strong material with low maintenance : </h3> <p>The tool should not require high maintenance as it is difficult to find resources to repair in the region it is going to be used. Also, excessive maintenance will lead to an increase in their expense
</p>
<h3> Easy and convinent to use : </h3> <p>The functioning should be simple and not complex. They will be able to adapt easily as the workers are not used to using complex tools
</p>
<h3>Not get affected by water and muddy marshes: </h3> <p>The tool will interact with water and muddy marshes a lot of times and the material used should to make the tool should not lose its strength or get affected by water or muddy marshes or else the tool will get damaged and it will lead to heavy maintainance
</p>
<h3> Should carry good amount of load at once : </h3> <p>Salt pan workers carry a high amount of load for long-distance barefooted. The tool should be designed in a manner to carry a good amount of load so that their efficiency is increased and are able to carry more load in a single trip
</p>
