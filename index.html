<p>We have got to this problem from studying the various documentaries made on the near seashore salt pan field workers in the state of Tamil-Nadu and Gujarat. These fields due to being in proximity to the sea are highly marshy and in certain seasons extremely difficult to traverse through.</p>

<div style="text-align: center"><img alt="home-44ca3c9c.png" src="assets/home-44ca3c9c.png" width="300" height="300"></div>

<p>A vast majority of near salt-pan field are concetrated in the coastline of states of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Gujarat. In/Near the Rann of Gujarat the salt pans can be situated much far away from sea inside the land to as far as 50 kilometers. While the almost all of the Salt-pan fields along the coastline of Maharashtra, malabar and coromandal are situated in the close viscinity of sea.</p>
<h2 class="mume-header" id="how-salt-marshes-are-formed">How Salt Marshes are formed:</h2>
        

<p>A salt marsh, also known as a coastal salt marsh or a tidal marsh, is a coastal ecosystem found between land and open salt water that is regularly flooded by the tides. A salt marsh begins when mud and silt are deposited along a sheltered part of the coastline. This is because rates of deposition are greater than transportation due to the lack of energy in the waves. Often salt marsh is found on the inside of a coastal spit. The deposition builds up over time meaning that the mud breaks the surface to form mudflats. These salt marshes also protect shorelines from erosion by buffering wave action and trapping sediments. They reduce flooding by slowing and absorbing rainwater and protect water quality by filtering runoff, and by metabolizing excess nutrients.</p>

<h4>Saltpan worker in Gujarat: Ambubhai</h4>
<p>Ambubahi, Saltpan worker in Gujarat: &quot;The season starts at around this time only in october, it depends on the monsoon. Now we have started to migrate to there with all our family and livelihood. Though the region is still flooded and it is very difficult to go traverse through those regions. Often if possible in some places the tractors are used, which also get stuck in the marsh many times. We had used them for taking our things there, though not everyone has than option. It depends on the location or difficulty of marsh and wheather one can afford that.&quot;</p>

<p>It is a herculean task to carry the equipment over the marshy tract as no vehicle can negotiate the road in the post-monsoon season. Workers carry everything by hand, including this generator, using a corrugated sheet.  </p>

<div style="text-align: center"><img alt="home-5af2330c.png" src="assets/context_multi.png" width="600" height="300"></div>

<h2>Understanding the problem in user context</h2>
<p> Understanding the problem space in which a user functions is a very important aspect to innovate or design a product for a user. So for salt pan workers, they have to carry huge machines like pumps, tools for agriculture through the marshy lands in which their legs can get struck and also sometimes even the machine due to its weight gets buried under the soil. 
</p>
     <h2>How do marshes affect their operation:</h2>  
<div style="text-align: center"><img alt="home-44ca3c9c.png" src="assets/Context_tract.png" width="300" height ="200"></div>
<p>A seasonal salt marsh located just 10Kms from Arabian sea.This area is under water during the monsoon months and salt farming starts early October, after the water starts  to recede. The Salt workers continue to live and work in this area for the next 7 months, making these salt pans their temporary home, living in make shift shacks, all around the pans. In shifting their housing to these salt pan areas, they have to bear a lot of pain and also time consuming in moving all their necessities to these areas while walking on these marshy lands. </p>


<h2 class="mume-header" id="close-to-shore-fields-in-india">Close to shore fields in India</h2>

<div style="text-align: center"><img alt="home-44ca3c9c.png" src="assets/home-44ca3c9c.png" width="300" height="250"></div>

<p>A vast majority of near salt-pan field are concetrated in the coastline of states of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Gujarat. In/Near the Rann of Gujarat the salt pans can be situated much far away from sea inside the land to as far as 50 kilometers. While the almost all of the Salt-pan fields along the coastline of Maharashtra, malabar and coromandal are situated in the close viscinity of sea.</p>

<h3>The heavy rainfall in coastal TN, AP and Gujarat increases the issues </h3>
<div style="text-align: center"><img alt="home-44ca3c9c.png" src="assets/Context_man.png" width="300" height="250"></div>
<p>The Agarias engaged in salt production, spent eight months of a year in remote locations devoid of any infrastructure for housing, health, education and drinking water, so for all these basic amenities they regularly travel to their native village through these marshy lands. While problems for Residents of near shore salt pan fields in Tamil Nadu and Andhra is way more serious. When these salt workers walk barefooted on these marshy lands, their feet get buried under the soil, where these small insects and microorganisms like bacteria and fungi can cause diseases which can be very dangerous.
</p>

<p>Understanding the actual problem that is at the core of the unmet needs is very important in order to proceed in the further stages of design process.For the case of the salt pan workers living and working in the fields near the sea shore, though it was very evident that what was their unmet needs. But it was not very clear what exact kinds of issues and problems they were facing. So it was very essential for us to study mechanics working behind difficulty in walking in swamp soil and things getting stuck in mud.<br></p>
<div style="text-align: center"><img alt="Comprehension-4f4e69f9.png" src="assets/Comprehension-4f4e69f9.png" width="300" height="200" ></div>
<p>Now as discussed in the previous stages, at times when monsoon starts to with draw they start to move to the salt pans from their native villages. Now they have to transfer their complete family including children and livelihood. This include the things of basic necessity, ration, house building material, burning woods etc. These constitute heavy weight. On other occasion they need to transport goods or heavy equipments through lands flooded by tidal waves.</p>
<h2 class="mume-header" id="detailed-study-on-soil-composition-of-the-marshes">Detailed study on soil composition of the Marshes</h2>

<p>From our detailed study on these salt pan workers adnd the conditions associated with the marshes. We found out:</p>
<div style="text-align: center"><img alt="Comprehension-2b292792.png" src="assets/Comprehension-2b292792.png" width="300" height="250"></div>
<ul>
<li>In general these Marshes consist of following layers: litter, Peat, Muck, Minerals/oil </li>
<li>The top layer of marshes are the one with most water content and act like a suction and pull any weight that is on the soil downwards.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="mume-header" id="difficulty-associated-with-walking">Difficulty associated with walking</h2>

<ul>
<li>So when a saltpan worker tries to traverse through these marshes, he faces two major difficulty.</li>

<div style="text-align: center"><img alt="Comprehension-8d4f416d.png" src="assets/Comprehension-8d4f416d.png" width="300" height="200" ></div>
<ul>      
<li>Firstly the legs get stuck in the top layer needs to pulled up everytime with lots of energy</li>
<li>Secondly the next leg needs to be moved forward against a dense soil resistance, which agains consumes a lots of energy</li>

<li>Vehilces need traction to move forward but on such a muddy there is lots of skidding</li>
<li>The marshses are uneven there can be a very large invisible hole under the water where one on the wheel will get stuck badly.</li>

<li>With no other choices left they to labour for hours for to use some make shift things like the above image shows.</li>
<li>They put the heavy object to trasport on a plank or a sheet of tin.</li>
<li>Ropes are tied and the things are pulled mannually by the saltpan workers</li>   
</ul>
<div style="text-align: center"><img alt="Comprehension-3f837bb9.png" src="assets/Comprehension-3f837bb9.png" width="300" height="200" ></div>
<ul>
<li>The working conditions are harsh and such a high energy intensive tasks leads to dehydration and high fatigue in the body</li>
<li>Sometimes just due to these problems they have to take a very long alternate routes to reach their destination.</li>
<li>Marshes can be very if help does not arrive in dire cases.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="mume-header" id="force-analysis-of-situation-leading-to-difficulty">Force analysis of situation leading to difficulty.</h2>
<p>Case of feet getting stuck:</p>
<ul>
<li> The top soil acts like a suction and when feet is inside the mud it is very difficult to pull up due to creation of vaccum kind of conditions.</li>
<li>Thus, this requires very large amount of energy for the person or animal to walk </li>
</ul>
<p>Case of Vehicles getting stuck:</p>
<ul>
<li>Due to being heavy vehicles easily get stuck in marshes, same is more frequent in case of loaded vehicles.</li>
<li>The wheels do not get enough traction and hence are not able to move forward.</li>
<li>The higher torque applied the higher amount of mud is displaced and the vehicle gets further deep.</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: center"><img alt="Comprehension-66ea97da.png" src="assets/Comprehension-66ea97da.png" width="300" height="200"></div>
<ul>
<li>The stuck vehicle is generally rescued only by a horizontal pull from another vehicle, which suggest that forward traction is essential getting out of mud.</li>
<li>The other vehicle brought to tow the stuck vehicles also have chances of getting stuck.</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: center"><img alt="Comprehension-86f2851d.png" src="assets/Comprehension-86f2851d.png" width="300" height="200" ></div>
<h2 class="mume-header" id="use-of-animals-to-do-the-labour"> Use of animals to do the labour</h2>

<ul>
<li>In some underdeveloped regions in TN these salt pan workers can&apos;t afford buying tractors or bigger vehicles</li>
<li>Animals are employed to pull the load across the muddy wetlands.</li>
<li>The hoofs of the cattle are very pointed and small area are meant for  solid ground only.</li>
<li>It becomes extremely difficult for them to walk on these marshes, let alone pulling the load alongside.<br></li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: center"><img alt="Comprehension-4a17ab87.png" src="assets/Comprehension-4a17ab87.png" width="300" height="200"></div>
<ul> 
<li>In the event of even a single wheel gets stuck and the animals are unable to pull they get quickly exhausted</li>
<li>In such situation it becomes extremely difficult for these salt pan workers to retrieve the goods.</li>
</ul>

<div id="Checks" class="tabcontent">
      <h1>Checks</h1>
Check is the most valuable stage in design innovation. It gives a clear direction to the design of product, without losing focus on the target user needs. After discussing and researching about all the possible details and information related to the problems these poor people face in salt marshers. We needed to make something for them, that will help them ease their troubles. We decided to target each small problem that we learnt from our detail comprehension and include it in our checklist as a feature that our product will try to accomodate. Each of these feature will mitigate the troubles caused by the individual or a multiple of small problems. <br>
<div style="text-align: center"><img alt="Comprehension-6eaccba7.png" src="assets/checklist.png" width="500" height="350"></div>
Here our target users are the salt pan workers and the following are the checks needed to be taken into account :

<h3> Require less effort and have low weight as compared to jugaad they currently use : </h3> <p>There are heavy loads (for ex: generator) that are to be carried using this tool. The weight of the tool itself should not be very high otherwise it will increase the overall load and make load carrying harder. The tool is to be designed in order to reduce the efforts they currently put in to carry load
</p>
<h3> Must be affordable : </h3> <p>The workers do not have high income and hence the tool needs to be affordable and easily available</p>
<h3> Made of strong material with low maintenance : </h3> <p>The tool should not require high maintenance as it is difficult to find resources to repair in the region it is going to be used. Also, excessive maintenance will lead to an increase in their expense
</p>
<h3> Easy and convinent to use : </h3> <p>The functioning should be simple and not complex. They will be able to adapt easily as the workers are not used to using complex tools
</p>
<h3>Not get affected by water and muddy marshes: </h3> <p>The tool will interact with water and muddy marshes a lot of times and the material used should to make the tool should not lose its strength or get affected by water or muddy marshes or else the tool will get damaged and it will lead to heavy maintainance
</p>
<h3> Should carry good amount of load at once : </h3> <p>Salt pan workers carry a high amount of load for long-distance barefooted. The tool should be designed in a manner to carry a good amount of load so that their efficiency is increased and are able to carry more load in a single trip
</p>

<h2 class="mume-header" id="Designing-an-improved-flat-sledge-to-be-pulled-with-better-ergonomics">Designing an improved flat sledge with better ergonomics also pullable by animals or an engine</h2>
    
<div style="text-align: center"><img alt="Comprehension-6eaccba7.png" src="assets/diagram.jpg" width="500" height="300"></div>
Sledge is used in many parts of world to carry things where wheels won't go.This idea is much of inspired by such things used in snow and muddy lands to transport. The reason being the flat bottom surface. For similar reasons in many parts of boats and canoes being used around the world to travel through salt marshes.The idea is to design a better sledge which would be flat and less possibility to get stuck in mud unlike wheels of vehicles.
    
<h3 class="mume-header" id="Design-improvements:sledge-to-be-pulled-by-animals-with-boots">Design-improvements: sledge can be pulled by cattle with flat boots</h3>
<div style="text-align: center"><img alt="Comprehension-6eaccba7.png" src="assets/cart_in_water.png" width="300" height="200"></div>
<p>Cattle/Bulls are used since long in these areas to for transport in form of bullock cart. These saltpan workers during non salt producing season live in their actual villages. In most of AP and TN these villages domesticate cattles for various purposes. During the time of migration to saltpans generally the poorer saltpan worker carry their things and livelyhoods on bullock carts on the solid lands until they arrive the salt marshes near saltpans. Then their problm starts.</p>
<div style="text-align: center"><img alt="Comprehension-6eaccba7.png" src="assets/mud_boots.png" width="300" height="300"></div>
<ul>
<li> Pulling the slegde with some 100-300kg things manually for long distances in such humidity and dehydration conditions causes serious issues as discussed in previous sections.
<li> While going from solid land to salt marshes they still would be continue employing animals to pull    
<li>This slegde would be pulled by animals, which would be equipped with special boots to walk in mud properly.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="mume-header" id="advantages">Advantages:</h4>
<div style="text-align: center"><img alt="Comprehension-6eaccba7.png" src="assets/cattle_boots.jpeg" width="300" height="250"></div>
<ul>
<li>Cheap and affordable, villagers in India and salt pan workers in regions of TN, AP are much likely to own cattle instead of tractors.</li>
<li>The main work will be designing a simple sledge and the proper kind of boots for cattle.</li>
<li>The slegde can be desinged such a way that the workers can easily make it themselves using materials available around them.</li>
<li>The boots idea can be taken from the flat boots used by humans in some parts of the world which allows them to walk properly on mud.</li>
<li>Unlike the bullock carts there will be very less possibility of the flat sledge getting stuck.</li>
<li>Animals will require very less labour due to the shape of sledge and their boots.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="mume-header" id="limitations">Limitations:</h4>

<ul>
<li>The saltpan workers may still find it difficult to switch from wheels to sledge when going from solid ground to marshy ground or vice versa.</li>
<li>High friction needs to dealt with.</li>
<li>Design of boots which would be feasible for animals to wear would be challenging.</li>
</ul>

<div style="text-align: center"><img alt="Comprehension-6eaccba7.png" src="assets/raft.png" width="350" height="250"></div>
<ul>
<li>To mitigate the portability issue of such a sledge, proposition is to use an inflatable raft in its place.</li>
<li>The raft can be fit with a tough material at the bottom to counter friction.</li>
<li>A small pump will be needed to inflate it and use and deflate when again on solid ground.</li>
<li>Again the animals will be pulling equiped with boots.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="mume-header" id="advantages-1">Advantages</h4>

<ul>
<li>This will be more portable than the slegde can be easily switched to, when going from solid land to marsh.</li>
<li>The buoyancy will make it more easy to pulled by animals.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="mume-header" id="limitations-1">Limitations</h4>

<ul>
<li>Can be easily made by the salt pan workers or villagers themselves, it need to be made available to them by purchase.</li>
<li>A seperate pump will be needed to inflate it.</li>
<li>The outer material would be made very tough to resist the friction induced damage.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="mume-header" id="mechnising-the-above-modes-instead-of-animals-using-a-cheap-mootorcycle engine">Mechanising the above modes instead of animals, using a cheap motorcycle engine.</h3>
<div style="text-align: center"><img alt="Comprehension-6eaccba7.png" src="assets/paddle_wheel.png" width="350" height="250"></div>
<ul>
<li>In the above modes use of cattle still may not be with less issues.</li>
<li>Instead, a cheap bike engine can be used to drive the slege across the marsh.</li>
<li>Just simply an engine from a used cheap bike can be taken out with a wheel. Rigid, Flaps would be attached to the circumference.</li>
<li>So the wheel will rotate and only push the sledge or rod forward, It won&apos;t get stuck in mud.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="mume-header" id="advantages-2">Advantages</h4>

<ul>
<li>It will be more efficient than cattle pulling.</li>
<li>A used bike Engine can be simply resued, just some fuel is needed to drive the sledge or raft through the marsh.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="mume-header" id="limitations-2">Limitations</h4>

<ul>
<li>Making the overall system robust and durable will be a challenge</li>
<li>It can be little unsafe under certain situations</li>
<li>Again it will be only usable in marshes, back to solid ground it would be a difficult job for saltpan workers to carry that home.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="mume-header" id="Using-normal-bullock-cart-with-tangent-side-wards-fitting-and-animals-with-boots">Designing tangent pad fitting for bullockCart/tractor wheels to prevent getting stuck</h3>
<div style="text-align: center"><img alt="Comprehension-6eaccba7.png" src="assets/padding.jpg" width="300" height="300"></div>
<ul>
<li>This would be one of the most simplest solutions among above listed</li>
<li>Just a simple flat wheel fittings for bullock cart, tangential sidewards to the wheel which will help them traverse through marshes.</li>
<li>The side fittings for wheels will be just like those for tractors helping in making wheel wider and less prone to getting stuck.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="mume-header" id="advantages-and-limitations">Advantages and Limitations</h4>

<ul>
<li>Simplistic, convinent and cheap solution.</li>
